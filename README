ECPU2 - AS3 Implementation and Continuation of The ECPU Project.
(C) Copyright 2011, Richard Marks

ECPU2 is an application containing the ECPU assembler, disassembler, and emulator programs.
This will enable you to write programs using ECPU Assembly instructions, assemble and execute 
your programs using a single IDE interface.

You can export your programs as assembled binary files which you can import and execute using the
emulator.

This project is being made open-source, and you may use this code as you wish as long as you retain
my copyright above in the project. Thank you.

The ECPU Project
(C) Copyright 2010, Richard Marks

The ECPU Project is a project that is a personal challenge of mine. 
The idea started with writing a virtual machine that could execute a stream 
of instructions and perform the associated actions.

At the time of this writing, the project has matured into an emulator, assembler, and disassembler.
There is a micro-language of 37 instructions that somewhat resembles an assembly dialect. 

You write simple programs in the assembly language that I've dubbed ECPU Assembly, 
and then you run them through the ECPU Assembler, which creates an ECPU Binary program 
that the emulator can execute.
